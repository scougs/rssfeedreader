    On week eight of the 
    %a{:href => "https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive/london"}General Assembly Web Development Immersive  
    we we were put into groups of three and assigned projects.
  %p
    What you see here is the result of eight long days of sketching, coding, debating, and testing.

  %h3 The Assignement
  %p
    We were given 8 days to build a 
    %a{:href => "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product"}
      MVP 
    that met the following requirements:
  %br
    
  %blockquote
    You will create an application to retrieve and save rss feeds into a database.
    %br
    %br
    
    Users should be able to subscribe and manage their accounts, manage the feeds they wants to follow, archive / bookmark / socially publish the posts and define a feed that they follow as public or private on their profile and see other users profiles and feeds.
    %br
    %br
    
    The efficiency of the DB is a primary concern - multiple subscriptions to a single feed should cause it to be stored only once.
  %br
  

  %h3 The Product
  %p
    One week after being given the requirements, we proudly presented Freeder to our colleagues. 
  %p
    Should you be interested the code is available on 
    %a{:href => "https://github.com/scougs/rssfeedreader"}
      GitHub.
